# project Name: GPS

# Project Synopsis : 
## The Global Positioning System (GPS) is the most common surveying instrument today where we can obtain accuracies of high order with a speed and cost efficiency that has not previously been available to the survey community. Precise positioning is possible using GPS receivers at reference locations providing correction and relative positioning data for remote receivers. 

# Project Description :
## The main objective of this project is to do practical evaluation of the influence of GPS error sources, processing strategies and reference stations on positioning accuracy e.g. single point positioning solution and relative positioning solution with different reference stations.
